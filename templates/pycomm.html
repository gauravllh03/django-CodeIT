        <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="headline">Comments in Python Programming</h1>
        <div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>Although comments do not change the outcome of a program, they still play an important role in any programming and not just Python. <strong>Comments</strong> are the way to improve the readability of a code, by explaining what we have done in code in simple english. In this guide, we will learn about comments in Python and their types.</p>
        <h2>Python comments</h2>
        <p>Before we go through an example of <strong>comments in Python</strong>. Lets first understand the need of comments in Python or in any programming language.</p>
        <p>A comment is text that doesn&#8217;t affect the outcome of a code, it is just a <strong>piece of text</strong> to let someone know what you have done in a program or what is being done in a block of code. This is especially helpful when someone else has written a code and you are analysing it for bug fixing or making a change in logic, <strong>by reading a comment you can understand the purpose of code much faster then by just going through the actual code</strong>.</p>
        <p>Lets see how a comment looks like in Python.</p><div class="lq"><div data-type="ad" data-publisher="Beginnersbook.com" data-format="300x250" data-zone="ros" ></div></div>
        <pre># This is just a text, it won't be executed.
        
        print("Python comment example")</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong><br />

        <h2>Types of Comments in Python</h2>
        <p>There are two types of comments in Python.<br />
        1. Single line comment<br />
        2. Multiple line comment</p>
        <h2>Single line comment</h2>
        <p>In python we use # special character to start the comment. Lets take few examples to understand the usage.</p>
        <pre># This is just a comment. Anything written here is ignored by Python</pre>
        <h2>Multi-line comment:</h2>
        <p>To have a multi-line comment in Python, we use triple single quotes at the beginning and at the end of the comment, as shown below.</p>
        <pre>'''
        This is a 
        multi-line
        comment
        '''
        </pre>
        <h2>Python Comments Example</h2>
        <p>In this Python program we are seeing three types of comments. Single line comment, multi-line comment and the comment that is starting in the same line after the code.</p>
        <pre>'''
        We are writing a simple program here
        First print statement.
        This is a multiple line comment.
        '''
        print("Hello Guys")
        
        # Second print statement
        print("How are You all?")
        
        print("Welcome to BeginnersBook") # Third print statement</pre>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong><br />

        <h2># character inside quotes</h2>
        <p>When # character is encountered inside quotes, it is not considered as comment. For example:</p>
        <pre>print("#this is not a comment")</pre>
        <p>Output:</p>
        <pre>#this is not a comment</pre>
